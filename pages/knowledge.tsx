      <p>Welcome to our resource center on building healthy soil the natural way.</p>
      <h2>Feed the Soil, Not the Plant</h2>
      <p>Healthy plants start with living soil. Use compost, mulches, and microbe-rich amendments to create a thriving ecosystem beneath your feet.</p>
      <h2>Encourage Biodiversity</h2>
      <p>Diverse plantings and reduced tillage support beneficial insects and microorganisms that keep your garden in balance.</p>
      <h2>Water Wisely</h2>
      <p>Deep, infrequent watering trains roots to grow down where moisture lingers, reducing stress and conserving water.</p>
